# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This README gathers all the project management process documentation, making it easy to find guidance and standards in one spot.

## Summary of Project Management Processes

OctoAcme uses a **customer-first, cross-functional approach** to project management that ensures consistent, repeatable execution across all projects.

### Our Approach
- **Customer-first philosophy**: We prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: Projects are broken down into small, testable increments for faster feedback and continuous improvement
- **Clear ownership**: Every project has defined roles with explicit responsibilities and accountability
- **Data-informed decisions**: We measure impact and iterate based on evidence and metrics

### Project Lifecycle
Projects move through five key phases:

1. **Initiation**: Validate business need, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight project one-pager
2. **Planning**: Break work into shippable increments, identify dependencies, and create a release plan
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, and iterate with daily standups and weekly delivery syncs
4. **Release & Deployment**: Deploy to production following standardized procedures with rollback plans
5. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**: Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements

### Key Roles
- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs and approvals

### Core Artifacts
- **Project One-pager**: Problem statement, goals, success metrics, and timeline
- **Backlog**: Prioritized list of work items with acceptance criteria
- **Risk Register**: Active risks with impact, likelihood, owner, and mitigation plans
- **Release Plan**: Timeline, milestones, and deployment strategy
- **Definition of Done**: Quality standards and completion criteria
- **Retrospective Notes**: Learnings and action items for improvement

### Team Rhythm & Checkpoints
- **Daily standups** (15 min): Progress, blockers, and dependencies
- **Weekly delivery sync**: Demo progress, updates, and flagged risks
- **Sprint/milestone demos**: Show completed work to stakeholders
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**: High-level status and key decisions
- **Regular retrospectives**: Continuous learning and process improvement
